				<summary>Taare Zameen Par, also known as Like Stars on Earth in English, is a 2007 Indian Hindi-language drama film produced and directed by Aamir Khan. The film stars Khan himself, along with Darsheel Safary, Tanay Chheda, Sachet Engineer, Vipin Sharma and Tisca Chopra. The film explores the life and imagination of Ishaan (Safary), an 8-year-old boy who, despite excelling in art, has poor academic performance which leads his parents to send him to a boarding school, where a new art teacher Nikumbh (Khan) suspects that he is dyslexic and helps him to overcome his reading disorder.

					Creative director and writer Amole Gupte initially developed the idea with his wife Deepa Bhatia, who served as the film's editor. Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy composed the film's score, and Prasoon Joshi wrote the lyrics for many of the songs. Principal photography took place in Mumbai and in Panchgani's New Era High School, and some of the school's students make appearances.
					
					Taare Zameen Par made its theatrical debut in India on 21 December 2007, earning ₹1.35 billion worldwide, thus proving to be a commercial success. It received widespread critical acclaim, with praise for its novel story, screenplay, direction, dialogues, soundtrack and performances of the cast. The film also proved to be vital in raising awareness about dyslexia.
